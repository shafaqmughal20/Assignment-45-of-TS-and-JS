//45.Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
//defien a finction to create a car object with options..
function create_car(manufacturer, model) {
    var options = [];
    for (var _i = 2; _i < arguments.length; _i++) {
        options[_i - 2] = arguments[_i];
    }
    //Initializ a car object with manufacturer and model
    var car = {
        manufacturer: manufacturer,
        model: model
    };
    // Add aditional options for car object
    options.forEach(function (option) {
        var _a = option.split(":"), key = _a[0], value = _a[1];
        car[key.trim()] = value.trim();
    });
